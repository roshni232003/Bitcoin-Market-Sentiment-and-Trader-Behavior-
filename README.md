Data Science: Relationship Between Bitcoin Market Sentiment and Trader Behavior 

 

📌 Project Overview 

This project explores the relationship between Bitcoin Market Sentiment (Fear vs. Greed) and Trader Behavior (profitability, leverage, volume, risk) using two datasets: 

Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset (historical_data.csv) 

Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid (fear_greed_index.csv) 

The goal is to analyze how trading actions align or diverge from overall market sentiment and identify hidden trends that could influence trading strategies.
